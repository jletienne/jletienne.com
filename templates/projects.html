            <a href=projects>  <h3> Arduino Powered Wi-Fi Enabled Smart Lights </h3> </a>
            <p> You think we can afford the Phillips Hue? what do i look like I'm made of money!</p>
            <p> In my day if you wanted to make smart lights you made them yourself!</p>

            <a href=films>  <h3> RTB Films </h3> </a>
            <p> Don't worry you eating takeout, chilling on your couch, watching Netflix,
            you're a grown up now you don't need to make your own decisions</p>
            <p> Problem solved this RTB recommends movies for you to watch</p>
            <p> that's just one problem, I'm not doing the dishes for you</p>

            <a href=shopping>  <h3> Shopping Spider </h3> </a>
            <p> Describe your self in one word: </p>
            <p> Easy I'm like a cross between Steve Jobs, Sterling Archer, and Kawhi Leonard</p>
            <p> I wear the same thing every day, don't talk much, and use the same repetitive jokes when i do</p>
