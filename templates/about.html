      <br>
      I get it you can make a much better site on WordPress or Squarespace.
      That's fine with me, but to make something truly unique you need to build it yourself.
      That's why I didn't use Django. Ideally the site develops as I learn new skills.
      You're looking at a Framework. How to design cohesive experience on the internet.
      How to architect information in a clean and consistent manner.
      How to manage templates to reduce redunancy.
      And most importantly how to improve the skills you have to create something truly unique.
